A curse of immortality was placed upon him so that he would forever wander Teyvat.\n\n## Official Introduction\nThe confluence between the past and future. The original calamityhad been overturned, yetthe island in the skyset the earth to burn. Chalk pursues gold, in this time inopportune, theeclipseis swallowed by thecrimson moon. The future must atone for bygone mistakes, as the bond familiar falters and breaks— of the same blood, elders and the youth... Such is the cycle of the world, in truth. Dain, what is that strand of blonde hair to you? Someone you must kill? Or the object of your penitence? —A self-proclaimed prophet\n"

    "description": "For new members joining the Lightkeepers, few things are more fortunate than having a leader like Illuga. Though Lightkeepers witness the tragic aftermath of the Wild Hunt's rampages every day, and the atmosphere in their quarters can often grow heavy and oppressive, Illuga somehow remains positive. He not only manages all tasks efficiently but also offers careful, thoughtful support to his teammates. Walking beside him, it feels as if even the lantern in your hand glows a little warmer. Some people wonder why someone like him hasn't chosen to work in logistics, but instead insists on going to the dangerous frontlines. Without unwavering resolve and strong inner drive, even optimistic smiles will one day be drowned by the purple-black despair. Yet whenever they hear Illuga recite the Lightkeepers' oath with conviction, such doubts vanish from their hearts — undoubtedly, beneath his gentle exterior burns a fierce, blazing fire. What are the ideals and beliefs of the Lightkeepers? This is the question newcomers ask most often, and each Lightkeeper would answer differently. Yet there is always a common thread in these answers — protection and salvation, steadfastness and unwavering resolve. They speak of a bright outcome, or a noble vision, grand and magnificent beyond measure. But Illuga desires little beyond defeating the Wild Hunt, for he realizes that, in its current state,Piramidaalready embodies that ideal. Only those who have endured the nightmare can truly grasp how precious the daylight is. What he wishes to protect is simple — the present. A young and upcoming man part of the Lightkeepersas a Ratnik and is the adoptive son of Nikita, the current Starshyna.",
