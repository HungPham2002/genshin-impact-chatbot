Like the leisurelyadeptus of the cloudswho dispelled droughts with nourishing rain in the \"Full Record of Pristine Pavilion,\" and the Golden-Winged Kingwho purged plagues and banished pestilence in \"Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti.\" They are all beings of immense power, guardians of peace in every corner of the land, who the people hold in reverence and awe. And there was, in particular, a certain White Horse Adeptus, whose trail pervades many a book and folktale. Some say she became a steed as white as snow and, in the days of the Archon War, aided Rex Lapisin attaining supremacy over the mortal realm. Others whisper that her eyes, like amber touched with gold, hold the power to gaze through the desolate wastelands of time itself. Still others claim she has always lived on themoon, listening to the wishes of mortals, and keeping watch over the world of flickering lights below. Yet, amidst all these different accounts, none could truly capture her visage, nor paint a likeness of her form. Whether amidst gentle tea-time chatter, or in debates pouring out over ink-filled scrolls, each view was a glimpse through a keyhole — catching naught but fragments, never the full picture. In any case, she was as a shard of blessed light, a wild goose upon the snow, whose footprints vanish with the morning. Still, her yesteryears linger in the mortal dust, and her tale awaits its dawn into the world of the waking.",

    "content": "## Official Introduction\nAmong the people of Liyue, tales of the Adeptiare ever-abundant. Like the leisurelyadeptus of the cloudswho dispelled droughts with nourishing rain in the \"Full Record of Pristine Pavilion,\" and the Golden-Winged Kingwho purged plagues and banished pestilence in \"Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti.\" They are all beings of immense power, guardians of peace in every corner of the land, who the people hold in reverence and awe. And there was, in particular, a certain White Horse Adeptus, whose trail pervades many a book and folktale. Some say she became a steed as white as snow and, in the days of the Archon War, aided Rex Lapisin attaining supremacy over the mortal realm. Others whisper that her eyes, like amber touched with gold, hold the power to gaze through the desolate wastelands of time itself. Still others claim she has always lived on themoon, listening to the wishes of mortals, and keeping watch over the world of flickering lights below. Yet, amidst all these different accounts, none could truly capture her visage, nor paint a likeness of her form. Whether amidst gentle tea-time chatter, or in debates pouring out over ink-filled scrolls, each view was a glimpse through a keyhole — catching naught but fragments, never the full picture. In any case, she was as a shard of blessed light, a wild goose upon the snow, whose footprints vanish with the morning. Still, her yesteryears linger in the mortal dust, and her tale awaits its dawn into the world of the waking.",
