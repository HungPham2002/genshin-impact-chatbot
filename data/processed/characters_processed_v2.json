Though Lightkeepers witness the tragic aftermath of the Wild Hunt's rampages every day, and the atmosphere in their quarters can often grow heavy and oppressive, Illuga somehow remains positive. He not only manages all tasks efficiently but also offers careful, thoughtful support to his teammates. Walking beside him, it feels as if even the lantern in your hand glows a little warmer. Some people wonder why someone like him hasn't chosen to work in logistics, but instead insists on going to the dangerous frontlines. Without unwavering resolve and strong inner drive, even optimistic smiles will one day be drowned by the purple-black despair. Yet whenever they hear Illuga recite the Lightkeepers' oath with conviction, such doubts vanish from their hearts — undoubtedly, beneath his gentle exterior burns a fierce, blazing fire. What are the ideals and beliefs of the Lightkeepers? This is the question newcomers ask most often, and each Lightkeeper would answer differently. Yet there is always a common thread in these answers — protection and salvation, steadfastness and unwavering resolve. They speak of a bright outcome, or a noble vision, grand and magnificent beyond measure. But Illuga desires little beyond defeating the Wild Hunt, for he realizes that, in its current state,Piramidaalready embodies that ideal. Only those who have endured the nightmare can truly grasp how precious the daylight is. What he wishes to protect is simple — the present.",

A young and upcoming man part of the Lightkeepersas a Ratnik and is the adoptive son of Nikita, the current Starshyna.\n\n## Official Introduction\nFor new members joining the Lightkeepers, few things are more fortunate than having a leader like Illuga. Though Lightkeepers witness the tragic aftermath of the Wild Hunt's rampages every day, and the atmosphere in their quarters can often grow heavy and oppressive, Illuga somehow remains positive. He not only manages all tasks efficiently but also offers careful, thoughtful support to his teammates. Walking beside him, it feels as if even the lantern in your hand glows a little warmer. Some people wonder why someone like him hasn't chosen to work in logistics, but instead insists on going to the dangerous frontlines. Without unwavering resolve and strong inner drive, even optimistic smiles will one day be drowned by the purple-black despair. Yet whenever they hear Illuga recite the Lightkeepers' oath with conviction, such doubts vanish from their hearts — undoubtedly, beneath his gentle exterior burns a fierce, blazing fire. What are the ideals and beliefs of the Lightkeepers? This is the question newcomers ask most often, and each Lightkeeper would answer differently. Yet there is always a common thread in these answers — protection and salvation, steadfastness and unwavering resolve. They speak of a bright outcome, or a noble vision, grand and magnificent beyond measure. But Illuga desires little beyond defeating the Wild Hunt, for he realizes that, in its current state,Piramidaalready embodies that ideal. Only those who have endured the nightmare can truly grasp how precious the daylight is. What he wishes to protect is simple — the present.\n"

Still others claim she has always lived on themoon, listening to the wishes of mortals, and keeping watch over the world of flickering lights below. Yet, amidst all these different accounts, none could truly capture her visage, nor paint a likeness of her form. Whether amidst gentle tea-time chatter, or in debates pouring out over ink-filled scrolls, each view was a glimpse through a keyhole — catching naught but fragments, never the full picture. In any case, she was as a shard of blessed light, a wild goose upon the snow, whose footprints vanish with the morning. Still, her yesteryears linger in the mortal dust, and her tale awaits its dawn into the world of the waking.",
