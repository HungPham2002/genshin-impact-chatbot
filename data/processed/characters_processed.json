Together they set out on a journey to find The Sevenand reunite with the Traveler's lost sibling. Although players can choose the name they want to be referred by, the Traveler's Siblingrefers to the Traveler by their real name, regardless of their custom name. In Natlan, the Traveler also gains the Ancient Name TMN(\"TMN,\"Tumaini).\n\n## Ascensions and Stats\nToggle Ascension Materials Total Cost(0✦ → 6✦)\n\n## Elemental Alignment\nAt the beginning of the game and in The Crux Clashin Chapter II: Prologue -Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves, the Traveler is \"unaligned,\" a special elemental state exclusive to them. When unaligned, the color of the Traveler's \"vision\" and background when they are selected in the Character Menuis gray. Although the Traveler's Profile lists their Constellationproperly as Viator/Viatrix, attempting to open the Constellation tab will show a blank screen with \"Constellation Unavailable\" in the bottom-right corner. When unaligned, the Traveler has only one talent, Normal Attack:Past Memories. When unaligned, screens that show character cards with their elements show a gray \"no\" symbol (🚫︎) in the place of the element symbol. Shortly after the beginning of the game, the Traveler will unlock their Anemo Talents and Constellation by resonating with the first Statue of The Sevenin Mondstadt. They can resonate with any other Statue of The Seven they find and change their element to match the statue's element.See Teyvatfor each region's element. However, the Traveler does not immediately gain the Pyroelement upon resonating with a Statue of The Seven in Natlan, due to corrupted Ley Linesin the region. They instead unlock their abilities during Where All Hopes Liein Chapter V: Act V -Incandescent Ode of Resurrection, and are able to properly resonate with Natlan's Statues of the Seven following this quest.\n\n## Availability\nThe Traveleris obtained at the start of the game and is not featured in any Wishes.\n"

      "Official Introduction": "For new members joining the Lightkeepers, few things are more fortunate than having a leader like Illuga. Though Lightkeepers witness the tragic aftermath of the Wild Hunt's rampages every day, and the atmosphere in their quarters can often grow heavy and oppressive, Illuga somehow remains positive. He not only manages all tasks efficiently but also offers careful, thoughtful support to his teammates. Walking beside him, it feels as if even the lantern in your hand glows a little warmer. Some people wonder why someone like him hasn't chosen to work in logistics, but instead insists on going to the dangerous frontlines. Without unwavering resolve and strong inner drive, even optimistic smiles will one day be drowned by the purple-black despair. Yet whenever they hear Illuga recite the Lightkeepers' oath with conviction, such doubts vanish from their hearts — undoubtedly, beneath his gentle exterior burns a fierce, blazing fire. What are the ideals and beliefs of the Lightkeepers? This is the question newcomers ask most often, and each Lightkeeper would answer differently. Yet there is always a common thread in these answers — protection and salvation, steadfastness and unwavering resolve. They speak of a bright outcome, or a noble vision, grand and magnificent beyond measure. But Illuga desires little beyond defeating the Wild Hunt, for he realizes that, in its current state,Piramidaalready embodies that ideal. Only those who have endured the nightmare can truly grasp how precious the daylight is. What he wishes to protect is simple — the present.",
